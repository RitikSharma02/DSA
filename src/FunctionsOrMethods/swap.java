//The issue lies in how Java handles method arguments.
// Java passes arguments by value, not by reference. This means that when you call the swap() method
// and pass the variables a and b, the method receives copies of the values of a and b, not the actual variables themselves.

//So, any changes made to a and b inside the swap() method only affect the copies, not the original variables in the main() method.

//        Hereâ€™s the problem:


//You swap the values of the copied variables inside the method,
// but that has no effect on the original a and b in the main() method.
//After returning from swap(), a and b in the main() remain unchanged.
